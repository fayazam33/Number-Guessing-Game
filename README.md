 I use here Html , CSS  , Javascript.
 The rules for the game is-

**1.Start the Game:**
Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
The game will randomly generate a secret number within a defined range (starting from 1 to 10).
You will have 10 lives to guess the number correctly.

After the game starts, you will be prompted to guess the secret number.
Enter a number in the input box and click the "Check" button to submit your guess.

Your score will increase by 10 points.
The level will increase by 1, and the number range will expand.
You will also gain 5 extra lives.
If your guess is too low, you will be told to try a higher number.
If your guess is too high, you will be told to try a lower number.

**4.Losing Lives:**
Each wrong guess will cost you 1 life.You will see a message indicating if the guess was too high or too low. Recent guesses will be displayed, showing all the numbers you've guessed.

Afterward, the game will restart automatically.
